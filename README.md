Going through Sandi's book 99bottles of OOP...

This is my attempt at a shameless green test-passing solution for the 99bottles of beer problem.

Sandi's ShamelessGreen flog score is 25.6.  Mine is 38.3.

The book is great because it teaches why the rules, best-practices and guidelines for good OOD and development are not inviolable and that there are tradeoffs that need to be weighed carefully.

I am, once again, learning from Sandi that there are times when violating DRY is alright if it prevents too much abstraction, which would otherwise raise the cost of change (level of cognitive overhead during maintenance).
